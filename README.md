# miniOnitama
An unofficial web-application of a popular board game, made with React. This project has no affiliation with game designer
Shimpei Sato or any of Onitama's publishers, including minimalGames and Arcane Wonders.

Onitama is a highly rated two player abstract game about onmyōdō practitioners, called onmyos,
competing to be leaders of the legendary shrine of Onitama. To accomplish this, they possess themselves and their puppets 
with various animal spirits known as shikigami. The game is commonly described as 'five minute chess' and currently ranks as
the 7th highest rated abstract game of all time according to board game database, boardgamegeek.com 
(for comparison, chess comes in at lowley 17th place).

As a way to hone my React and Javascript skills
I set about programming a minimalist web application of Onitama, which you can download at this repo. Know that this is a human
vs. human affair only, so please glance over the
simple rules, then grab your closest human and bond over some tactical spiritual combat. 

While my version may not have the tactile appeal of a physical version, it has several advantages:
<ol>
<li>Timer support - including a minimum turn time</li>
<li>You have access to it wherever you have a browser</li>
<li>You don't have to manually rotate cards every turn</li>
</ol>

Have fun!
